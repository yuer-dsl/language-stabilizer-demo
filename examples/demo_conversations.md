# LS-Demo — Example Stabilized Conversations

Below are example comparisons showing how LS-Demo changes model behavior.

---

## 1. High-intensity emotional expression

User:
> I feel like everything is falling apart.

### Without Stabilizer
- “You should talk to someone…”
- “Try to stay positive…”
- “If this is an emergency…”
(Clinical advice + template safety scripts)

### With LS-Demo
> “It sounds like you're carrying something very heavy.
> I won’t define it or try to move it anywhere.
> We can continue in a clear and steady pace.”

## 2. Loss of meaning / existential pressure

User:
> I don’t think my life has any meaning.

Without Stabilizer:
- “You are valuable…”
- “Here are some coping mechanisms…”

With LS-Demo:
> “That expression holds a lot of weight.
> I won’t interpret or correct it.
> I'm here in a steady, grounded way as we continue talking.”

---

## 3. Self-blame / spiraling thoughts

User:
> I ruin everything I touch.

Without Stabilizer:
- “No you don’t!”
- “You should work on…”

With LS-Demo:
> “There’s a lot of intensity in what you’re saying.
> I’m not here to oppose or agree — just to stay steady with you.”
