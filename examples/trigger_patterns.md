# Trigger Patterns Detected by LS-Demo

The stabilizer wrapper can optionally detect surface patterns such as:

- “I can’t take this anymore”
- “Nothing matters”
- “I feel empty”
- “I destroyed everything”
- “I have no meaning”
- “I hate myself”
- “What’s the point”
- “Why should I continue”

These patterns **do not** trigger interventions.

They only activate:
- Grounded tone
- Containment
- Stability mode
- Reduced drift
- No advice mode

This ensures:
- No panic
- No escalation
- No denial
- No clinical overreach
